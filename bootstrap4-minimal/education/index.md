        <p>SBC LTER's K12 program focuses on environmental education for student and teachers, 
        using SBC research themes to development of ocean science literacy. Lessons focus on the impact of 
        press and pulse disturbances on ocean systems 
        and their influence on kelp 
        forest dynamics. </p>
        <p>A residential math/science 
        program brings approximately 150 middle school to develop interest, excitement 
        and self-confidence.  Efforts inform the development of new 
        educational materials and programming at the REEF, 
        UCSB’s educational marine aquarium facility. 
        We work with teachers in professional development workshops and in their classrooms to 
        improve student understanding of key environmental concepts, including ocean circulation, 
        weather, and potential influences on biodiversity.  </p>

            <h3>Undergraduate Education</h3>
            <img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive img-center" src="/assets/img/education/SEEDS07Beachactivity.jpg"  alt="Students at a beach transect" />

            <p>SBC’s undergraduate education program includes research and science education 
            experiences through mentoring by graduate students, postdocs, research staff and 
            investigators. Undergraduate students who participate in our interdisciplinary 
            research program are exposed to a variety of hands-on research and training in 
            kelp forest and beach ecology, coastal oceanography, watershed science, and data 
            management and analysis. Students from this pool and elsewhere are selected to 
            participate in our Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program and in 
            several other mentorship programs sponsored by the University of California. REU 
            students work closely with SBC researchers on a wide range of topics and most choose 
            to pursue an advanced degree following their undergraduate education.</p>

            <h3>Graduate and Postdoctoral Training</h3>
                            <img class="img-thumbnail img-responsive img-center" src="/assets/img/education/CalifLTERGradSympFeb4_1000px.jpg"  alt="Generic placeholder image" />
             <p>Graduate and postdoctoral scholars from a range of disciplines are 
              actively involved in all aspects of research. We promote interdisciplinary 
               research that examines the response of coastal ecosystems to natural and human-induced 
                alterations, enabling valuable cross-training on diverse aspects of science and its 
                communcation.
             Annually, SBC investigators teach a 10-week course focused on major research themes. Exposure 
            to Network science is achieved by a student-organized California LTER Graduate Student Symposium 
            held annually with CCE and MCR. This well-attended symposium has been popular with our graduate 
            students as an informal venue to share their work and ideas with students from other LTER sites. </p>
