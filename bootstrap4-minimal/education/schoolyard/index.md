<!-- how to col: individual articles can vary the col widths; for full-width total should = 12. 
	col-md scales up (med to large desktops), and automatically stacks on phones and tablets (within the row). 

<p>site has two layouts: "articles", and "posts". Most pages are articles (like this one); posts are for news. </p>

			<p>SBC LTER's K12 program, Schoolyard LTER (sLTER), focuses on science and environmental education for both students and teachers using SBC research themes to improve ocean science literacy. These themes provide for the integrated development of programs and content that are aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and Common Core. </p>
			<p>Our K12 program is coordinated through <a href="https://msi.ucsb.edu/facilities-services/reef">The REEF</a>, part of the Marine Science Institute’s (MSI) <a href="https://msi.ucsb.edu/education/oceans-to-classrooms/about">Oceans-to-Classrooms (O2C)</a> education and outreach program. Equipped with state-of-the-art touch tanks and aquaria, The REEF provides an “Ocean View of the World” for students in Southern California.</p>

		 	<h2>For K12 Students</h2>
			<p>We use SBC LTER data to provide rich, place-based hands-on content to support learning in classrooms and after school programs. Grade-specific content is designed by SBC LTER's education coordinator with undergraduate and graduate students, and researchers.</p>
			<p>Together, the SBC Schoolyard Program, educational partnerships and public outreach activities have developed several types of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/education/resources">educational resources</a> using a variety of media - all designed to bring the Ocean to your Classroom!</p>

		</div>

		<div class="col-md-4">
		 	<h2>For Teachers</h2> 
			<p>Today's students are facing issues of literacy, and environmental and social justice, and our resources for teachers keep that in mind. Professional development for teachers uses their experience and expertise in 2-way exchanges that provide teachers with rich research experiences and students with a better understanding of today's classrooms</p>

			<h2>For the Public</h2> 
			<p><a href="https://msi.ucsb.edu/facilities-services/reef">The REEF</a> (always free) is open to the public on Fridays and Saturdays. </p>
			<p>At community events like Earth Day, Summer Solstice, and the Harbor Festival, we hold hands-on events and exhibits.</p>
			<p>Many local school host "Family Science Night" where our scientists and students organize specific events.</p>
