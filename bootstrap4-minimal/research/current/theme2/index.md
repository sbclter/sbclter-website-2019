<p>Our prior results showed that the physical structure of giant kelp alters water flow 
within the forest. Kelpâ€™s high productivity and metabolism also alter the chemical properties 
of seawater and its organic constituents. How this biophysical coupling changes with 
oceanographic conditions and the size and density of the forest to affect the kelp forest 
community remains largely unknown. Our current research is aimed at quantifying: 
</p>
                  
<ul>
    <li>the biophysical effects of kelp on water residence time and chemistry</li>
    <li>how these effects interact with microbial communities to influence the 
        processing and fate of dissolved organic matter</li>
    <li>the consequences of kelp-induced changes in seawater conditions on physiology, 
        behavior and eco-evolutionary dynamics of kelp forest inhabitants</li>
</ul>

<hr/>
<p>Giant kelp is a large source of C-rich dissolved organic matter and field work coupled with 
molecular studies are being used to understand the important role of microbes in the remineralization 
and trophic transfer of this material (below).</p>

<p>SBC researchers are investigating how kelp forest size and architecture modulate seawater 
flow and chemistry (e.g. pH, DO, pCO2, nutrients)
across different seasons and environmental conditions. </p>

 <p>Field and laboratory experiments are investigating how giant kelp modifies seawater pH and dissolved 
oxygen to affect the calcification, reproduction, metabolism and behavior of kelp forest consumers.</p>
