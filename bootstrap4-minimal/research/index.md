            <p>SBC LTER was established in April 2000 with the goal of advancing a predictive 
            understanding of how oceanic and terrestrial processes alter material flows to 
            influence the ecology of coastal ecosystems. Diverse and productive marine forests 
            of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, serve as the focal ecosystem for our research. </p>
