  abstract: This collection includes data from a 15-year (2008-2023) experiment designed
    to test the ecological consequences of increased storm disturbance on the structure,
    dynamics and productivity of the kelp forest community. The experiment consists
    of paired plots at five kelp forest sites located along the mainland coast of
    the Santa Barbara Channel. Increased disturbance frequency was simulated in one
    of the plots in each pair by removing giant kelp annually in winter while the
    other plot serves as a control that experiences natural levels of disturbance.
    A continual kelp removal treatment embedded with the kelp removal plot allowed
    the effects of giant kelp on the community to be evaluated. Changes in the kelp
    forest community were measured 1 to 2 times per season. The experimental removal
    of giant kelp ended in winter 2016 or 2017 (depending on the site) and sampling
    continued in all plots until spring 2023 to document the trajectory of recovery
    of the reef community from experimental kelp removal.

    cruises to survey hydrographic and biological parameters (e.g., nutrients, particulate
    carbon and nitrogen, and primary production). Cruises were conducted seasonally
    (2-3 times per year) on the R/V Pt Sur between 2001 and 2006. <br /> <br /> This
    collection is also complemented by Towed CTD Transects and shipboard meteorological
