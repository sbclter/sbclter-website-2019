- collectionName: 'SBC LTER: Ongoing long-term experiment of kelp removal (LTE KR)'
  abstract: 'This collection includes data from a long-term experiment designed to
    test the ecological consequences of increased storm disturbance on the structure,
    dynamics and productivity of the kelp forest community. The experiment consists
    of paired 40 m x 40 m plots at five kelp forest sites located along the mainland
    coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. Increased disturbance frequency is simulated
    in one of the plots in each pair by removing giant kelp annually in winter while
    the other plot in each pair serves as a control that experiences natural levels
    of disturbance. Changes in the structure (e.g. species abundance, diversity) and
    function (e.g. primary production of understory algae, detrital accumulation)
    of the kelp forest community are measured 1 to 2 times per season in permanent
    40 m x 2 m transects centered within each plot. Giant kelp is continually removed
    each seasonal within an additional transect in the annual kelp removal plot to
    evaluate the overall effects of giant kelp on the reef community. '
