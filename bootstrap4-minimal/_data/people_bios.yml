      I am an eco-physiologist researching the effects of climate and climate change on the performance of marine species. In particular, our lab investigates the impact on marine organisms of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations via ocean warming and acidification. We study how these environmental changes influence the regulation of physiological mechanisms that impact development, physiology, geographic distribution and survival. In the Santa Barbara area, our research focuses on the larvae of the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), and red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), two economically important species in the Santa Barbara kelp forests

The SBC LTER reaches across a large gradient of inorganic and organic nutrients and productivity and is an ideal location to investigate the sources and fate of organic matter and how its quality both affects and is affected by microbial community composition and associated processes. As an associate investigator I have participated in several of the oceanographic cruises, have studied rates of DOC production by giant kelp and am currently a Co- investigator (w/ Brzezinski) on the Cross Shelf Time Series (CSTS) campaign. The objective of the CSTS campaign is to resolve development of the temporal and spatial gradients in organic and inorganic nutrients in the near shore environment and to determine if those gradients are related to microbial activity and resulting community structure.

I am particularly interested how metapopulation processes, such as the size, connectivity, and arrangement of rocky reef habitats, influence the response of giant kelp populations to environmental variability, including wave disturbance and nutrient availability. The comprehensive, long-term data generated at the SBC LTER provide an unprecedented opportunity to study how numerous abiotic and biotic factors influence giant kelp population resilience and recovery dynamics over broad spatial and temporal scales.

      I am studying the spatiotemporal variability of giant kelp biomass and production across multiple scales of observation. My research combines satellite and aerial remote sensing with detailed field measurements to scale up local observations to larger areas and longer times. The spatiotemporal variability we measure with our multi-scaled observations will then be linked to press and pulse environmental drivers which also operate across a spectrum of scales (wave action, SST, nutrients, predation, bottom sedimentation, etc.). My project relies heavily on detailed field sampling of giant kelp biomass, frond density, and NPP conducted by the SBC LTER. In addition, the information management resources provided by the SBC LTER will allow me to archive the data products extracted from my extensive time series of satellite and aerial data.

A special research focus of my lab has been the coccolithophore species Emiliania huxleyi, which is central to the Earth's precipitation of calcium carbonate, the most important carbon reservoir in our planet. We study the genetic, functional and ecological diversity of coccolithophores in the SBC to improve our representation of populations in the modern ocean, and to build robust predictions in future climate scenarios. Our work has paid special attention to the effect of ocean acidification on the growth and calcification of coccolithophores, and more recently to the impact of oil spills on the physiology of phytoplankton, including neurotoxin production by diatoms. The NSF-funded flow cytometry facility enables monitoring the population structure and isolating phytoplankton cells from natural populations, and the NSF-funded titration system is used in our lab to determine seawater alkalinity using LTER and PnBs monthly sampling.

The physical processes of interest include tides, wind-driven circulation and mixing, internal waves, and submesoscale processes; the relative magnitude of these forcing mechanisms varies depending on where a kelp forest is located along the coast and what time of year it is. At an ecosystem level, I am interested in how primary production and nutrient cycling vary in response (or not) to the spatial and temporal variability imposed by physical processes. My work uses a variety of observational tools, including moorings, ship-based surveys, autonomous underwater vehicles, and remote sensing

      My main focus is on the mechanisms underlying sharp transitions in community state.  Marine benthic systems are known for these sharp transitions, which manifest themselves both as spatial patchiness and as rapid changes in community composition.  My graduate work used a combination of observational, experimental and theoretical approaches to explore the feedbacks that lead to these sudden shifts on reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel. I am continuing to pursue these questions in my postdoc, working to synthesize our results from the SBC LTER with insights from other LTER sites.  My interest in kelp forest community dynamics caused me to be very involved in developing the methods used by the SBC-LTER to estimate primary productivity by giant kelp, and I continue to be active in collaborative analyses of these data as well.

      Our lab studies bacteria and archaea involved in nitrogen cycling using molecular and stable isotope tools. I am interested in all aspects of how nitrogen is transported to and recycled within the SBC LTER ecosystem, and how those processes may change as a function of changing oxygen concentrations along the coast. We are particularly interested in the dynamics of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide

      I study the interactions between physical and biological processes in estuaries and the coastal ocean using numerical models.  My research focuses on understanding how oceanographic features, such as eddies, upwelling, and fronts, influence patterns of primary productivity, larval dispersal and connectivity, and ecological hot spots.  I use biophysical models, three-dimensional circulation models with particle tracking to represent the biological process, along with empirical data to address these interdisciplinary problems.

      Past work in the Turner lab has used various systems to investigate evolution, genetics, and behavior. Current projects are focused on marine sponges. We aim to improve our understanding of the diversity, evolutionary history, and ecological services of sponges in rocky reef habitats in California. These kelp forest habitats contain an astonishing diversity of suspension-feeding marine invertebrates. Together with other colonial filter feeders like tunicates, anthozoans, and bryozoans, sponges occupy a considerable portion of the hard-bottom substrate in shallow waters. Despite the important ecological roles and services of these taxa, we know little about the ecology or evolution of most species in this benthic community.

      I am responsible for directing the physical oceanographic monitoring effort at the core sites in kelp forests. I also coordinate much of the analysis and synthesis of oceanographic data obtained from a series of cruises during 2000-2006 and from moorings at the core sites from 2000 to the present. My research group operates an extensive array of high frequency radars for mapping surface currents in the coastal ocean encompassing all of the field sites within the SBC LTER.  Data from the array are important for identifying the spatial structure of currents causing transport through kelp forests at the core sites. A key objective of these efforts is to understand the role of ocean transport processes in the delivery of nutrients, biogenic particles, and other ecologically important waterborne materials to kelp forests on the inner shelf. In collaboration with a group from UC San Diego and the Moorea Coral Reef LTER, I am working to establish real time data nodes in the program and our first installation is on the Stearns Wharf in Santa Barbara.

      My research is part of an ongoing collaboration aimed at using molecular ecology to study giant kelp forests at local, regional and global scales. SBC LTER's long term investigations of the processes affecting the dynamics of giant kelp forests distributed throughout the Santa Barbara Channel allow us to contrast results of population genetics with the continuous body of data and hypotheses driven by long time studies. With co-funding from FCT (Portuguese Science Foundation) we isolated microsatellite markers from giant kelp, which we are using to estimate the genetic connectivity among sites within the SBC LTER region.  We are also using these genetic markers to investigate several hypotheses concerning biogeography, population dynamics and reproductive biology.

More specifically, our research examines relationships between land use patterns and algal biomass and invertebrate community structure, algal responses to the addition of nutrients, long-term relationships between hydrological conditions and invertebrate assemblages, the effects of exotic crayfish and mud snails on stream communities, and comparisons of stream communities in basins affected and unaffected by wildfires. Our investigations have been underpinned by food web investigations, including field experiments and observations on the effects of native trout and invertebrate predators on lower trophic levels and on the effects of grazers and disturbance on algal assemblages, as well as stable isotope analyses of stream food web structure through the seasons.  We interact closely with, and often advise, personnel from local, regional, state, and federal agencies on issues related to stream and river ecology.

      My work with the SBCLTER involves bringing an ongoing dataset of invertebrate settlement into the program. This dataset is geographically extensive (Mendocino to San Diego counties in California), and is unique in its length (currently at 22 years) and high frequency of collection (bi-weekly). Project goals include characterizing patterns of larval settlement in relation to oceanographic parameters and using population genetics to gain insights into possible larval connectivity and linking larval settlement to benthic population dynamics. Past work has identified geographical differences in shifting oceanographic regimes (e.g. El Nino/La Nina conditions and Pacific Decadal Oscillations) on settlement patterns between northern and southern California. Some applications include use of sea urchin settlement as a fishery independent measure of stock health, examination of differences in settlement of commercially harvested species inside and outside of no-take reserves (MPAs) and marine conservation areas, and the provision of long-term, geographically extensive library of invertebrate larvae to detect possible signals of ocean acidification. This work has been made possible by the development of an extensive collaboration with the fishing community, university researchers, marine resource managers, regulatory and public agencies, which now includes the SBCLTER.

      My SBC research focuses on the fate, proceesing, and ecological effects of organic subsidies exported from kelp forests to sandy beach ecosystems. I am responsible for the core monitoring of kelp wrack abundance on SBC sandy beaches and am particularly interested in the responses of beach communities and higher trophic levels to spatial and temporal variation in these subsidies. I am also interested in investigating the role of upper intertidal invertebrate consumers in the processing of kelp wrack and the remineralization of nutrients from this source in intertidal porewater.

Much of my current research focuses on the ecology of coastal benthic communities and interactions with the nearshore oceanography. As the SBC LTER Co-Director of Education I work with SBC scientists, staff, and students in various K-12 and public education programs. I lead the Biodiversity strand of the NSF-funded Math Science Partnership program: Pathways to Ecological Literacy focused on developing research-based environmental literacy learning progressions for 6-12 grades.

With UCSB and other LTER science education representatives, I develop content and programs to articulate the research of the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER, particularly for K-12 needs (students and teachers) and for undergraduates. We  incorporate standards-aligned, hands-on programs as well as current research in science education. UCSB's remarkable beach-front location allows for the design, development and implementation of unique and strategic STEM content which is derived directly from SBC research. The campus serves as the hub for our LTER Schoolyard programs, mainly through our teaching aquarium, the Research Experience & Education Facility (REEF, WILL PUT REEF LINK HERE).  At the REEF, UCSB undergraduates act as mentors to local high school students, and so gain teaching experience as they pass on their knowledge and research experience. Related SBC LTER K-12 outreach projects I am involved in are "Pathways to Ecological Literacy" (funded through MSP), and a collaboration with the Santa Barbara Unified School District and the UCB Lawrence Hall of Science which brings ocean science to local 6th graders via teacher professional development.

      I am a PhD student at UCLA working with James McWilliams.  I aim to diagnose and characterize the physical transport mechanisms on the inner-shelf of the Southern California Bight.  The transport pathways I am seeking to uncover occur in the along- and cross- shore directions.  In the cross-shore direction, I am examining transport between two boundaries: transport to/from the shelf to//from the surf-zone and offshore waters.  To perform these analyses I utilize very high resolution (less than 100m horizontal resolution) ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System) simulations.  The high resolution allows the submesoscale processes on the shelf to be examined with great detail.  The characterization of these flow patterns and their relative importance in material exchange is vital to understanding the nutrient and material fluxes into the kelp forests of the Santa Barbara Channel.

My work in the Carlson laboratory focuses on the short-term and long-term impacts of increasing pCO2 on the use of dissolved organic carbon by natural bacterioplankton communities. With this research focus, my graduate work will help to better constrain surface carbon budgets and enable predictions of the degree to which the global oceans will continue to be a sink for anthropogenic-derived CO2.

      I joined the Hofmann Lab as a PhD student in the Fall of 2018. Before coming to UC Santa Barbara, I received an MS from Sonoma State University, CA, where I studied the evolution of gene regulatory elements underpinning physiological losses-of-function in Antarctic fishes. As an undergraduate at Dickinson College, PA, I studied the responses of gastropod larvae and juveniles to ocean acidification and multiple stressors. Building off of these experiences, my research with the Hofmann Lab will integrate my background in molecular biology and gene regulation with my interest global change biology. I hope to better understand the cellular and evolutionary processes that limit or enable the capacity for rapid adaptation to environmental change. Specifically, I am interested in the evolutionary role of epigenetics and how environmental adaptation may act upon its processes. For example, how might DNA methylation respond to future ocean temperatures or pCO2 in closely-related stenotherms and eurytherms? What might this suggest for these organisms' capacities to adapt using an evolutionary framework that considers plasticity?

      I am a graduate student in the Hofmann Lab studying how marine invertebrates cope with climate change associated stressors such as marine heatwaves. Growing up, I had always been fascinated by animals and their interactions with the environment, but never in my wildest dreams did I think I would become a scientist studying these interactions. After graduating high school, I began my college career at my local community college, then transferred to UC Davis where I majored in Animal Biology. It was during my time at UC Davis that I got involved in undergraduate research studying the effects of climate change on marine invertebrates. By participating in undergraduate research, I received amazing mentorship from graduate students and professors I worked with along the way. This experience gave me confidence to pursue scientific research as career. As a Latin-American and first-generation college student I have recognized some of the many challenges associated with succeeding in environmental sciences. As I continue in with my graduate career, I am passionate about helping under-represented students in STEM overcome these challenges and increase their accessibility to scientific careers.

Sandy beaches along the southern California coast are receive organic matter and nutrient inputs through the deposition of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) wrack onto the beach. This material supports a variety of consumers through the provision of both habitat and food. I am interested in determining the extent of kelp inputs to beaches across a range of both types and during different seasonal conditions. I am also interested in how the variation in kelp inputs along the SBC LTER coastline controls community compositions and consumer behavior.

      Emily is interested in the effects of diet on thermal acclimation responses. A major assumption about thermal acclimation is that an individual will always respond to a given temperature in the same way. Emily uses a local omnivorous fish (opaleye) as a model system for exploring if/how diet may alter the way fish experience and respond to changes in environmental temperature.

      I joined the Hofmann Lab as a Ph.D. student in Fall of 2016. I am interested in studying the capacity of commercially important California fishery species to cope with the environmental stress associated with climate change and ocean acidification. I am pursuing two pathways to investigate this question. First, I am interested in looking at the physiological mechanisms by which organisms can rapidly adapt to environmental stressors in the hopes of forecasting which organisms will be resilient to the stress of a changing ocean. Our current investigations focus on the role of maternal provisioning and transgenerational plasticity as a potential avenue for resilience in early life stages. In addition, I am looking at how marine macrophytes, such as eelgrass, modify ocean chemistry and investigating the potential for these habitats to serve as local refuges from ocean acidification.

      I joined the Hofmann lab in 2016 with an interest in exploring how marine organisms respond to environmental stress induced by climate change. My current research focuses on how environmental stress experienced by marine invertebrates in the Santa Barbara Channel alters their reproduction and the subsequent development of their offspring. Understanding the degree in which different species can reproduce and develop successfully under stress induced by ocean warming and acidification, for example, is crucial for making models and/or predictions about how populations in the Santa Barbara Channel will fare under future climatic change. For this research I have mainly utilized the ecologically relevant purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), a key player in our coastal kelp forest ecosystem.

      I am a PhD student working with Bob Miller. I am investigating how the benthic suspension feeding community within kelp forests responds to both abiotic and biotic stressors such as thermal stress, food limitation, and competition. As anthropogenic climate change continues to warm our coastal oceans, benthic animals may experience prolonged periods of thermal stress as well as changes in both the quality and quantity of their main food source: plankton. Additionally, I am interested in how these communities respond to the introduction of nonnative species through competition for space and resources.

      I am interested in the biogeochemical cycling of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the marine environment through heterotrophic bacterioplankton processes.  DOC serves as an organic substrate for heterotrophic microbial production, and as a result of this production organic matter is then re-mineralized.  DOC availability and microbial processes therefore have important implications for the distribution of nutrients in marine ecosystems.  A preliminary study conducted by SBC LTER in 2005 showed that while DOC concentrations were observed to be low in offshore waters of the SB channel (equal to or less than oligotrophic values), in the near shore there was at times a large accumulation of DOC resulting in a striking gradient extending from Mohawk Kelp Forest several km into the Channel.  In the Santa Barbara Coastal ecosystem, a unique case exists in that the continental shelf is extremely narrow (being only a few km wide in areas), allowing greater potential for exchange between near shore rocky reef ecosystems and offshore waters.  In response to these observations, my Masters' research project was designed to assess the temporal and spatial variability of organic nutrients and heterotrophic bacteriplankton dynamics across this near shore shelf system.  16 monthly oceanographic cruises were conducted from January 2008-April 2009 along a transect from Mohawk Kelp Forest 3km into the channel. Measurements of dissolved and particulate organic matter, inorganic nutrients, and bacterioplankton abundance, activity and community structure were carried out.  Results will give a better understanding of biogeochemical cycling of organic matter in this near shore ecosystem.
