      My main focus is on the mechanisms underlying sharp transitions in community state.  Marine benthic systems are known for these sharp transitions, which manifest themselves both as spatial patchiness and as rapid changes in community composition.  My graduate work used a combination of observational, experimental and theoretical approaches to explore the feedbacks that lead to these sudden shifts on reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel. I am continuing to pursue these questions in my postdoc, working to synthesize our results from the SBC LTER with insights from other LTER sites.  My interest in kelp forest community dynamics caused me to be very involved in developing the methods used by the SBC-LTER to estimate primary productivity by giant kelp, and I continue to be active in collaborative analyses of these data as well.

The SBC LTER reaches across a large gradient of inorganic and organic nutrients and productivity and is an ideal location to investigate the sources and fate of organic matter and how its quality both affects and is affected by microbial community composition and associated processes. As an associate investigator I have participated in several of the oceanographic cruises, have studied rates of DOC production by giant kelp and am currently a Co- investigator (w/ Brzezinski) on the Cross Shelf Time Series (CSTS) campaign. The objective of the CSTS campaign is to resolve development of the temporal and spatial gradients in organic and inorganic nutrients in the near shore environment and to determine if those gradients are related to microbial activity and resulting community structure.

A special research focus of my lab has been the coccolithophore species Emiliania huxleyi, which is central to the Earth's precipitation of calcium carbonate, the most important carbon reservoir in our planet. We study the genetic, functional and ecological diversity of coccolithophores in the SBC to improve our representation of populations in the modern ocean, and to build robust predictions in future climate scenarios. Our work has paid special attention to the effect of ocean acidification on the growth and calcification of coccolithophores, and more recently to the impact of oil spills on the physiology of phytoplankton, including neurotoxin production by diatoms. The NSF-funded flow cytometry facility enables monitoring the population structure and isolating phytoplankton cells from natural populations, and the NSF-funded titration system is used in our lab to determine seawater alkalinity using LTER and PnBs monthly sampling.

My research combines satellite and aerial remote sensing with detailed field measurements to scale up local observations to larger areas and longer times. The spatiotemporal variability we measure with our multi-scaled observations will then be linked to press and pulse environmental drivers which also operate across a spectrum of scales (wave action, SST, nutrients, predation, bottom sedimentation, etc.). My project relies heavily on detailed field sampling of giant kelp biomass, frond density, and NPP conducted by the SBC LTER.

      My research involves exploring nutrient cycling in kelp forest ecosystems, with an emphasis on the carbon cycle. Using a variety of methodologies, including satellite observation, I study the physical and biotic controls on carbon delivery, uptake and export from this ecosystem and expand these results to larger temporal and spatial scales. The long term and extensive datasets of the SBC LTER will allow for a better understanding of carbon cycle variability in the kelp forest and help expose changes due to oceanographic cycles and climate change.

      Past work in the Turner lab has used various systems to investigate evolution, genetics, and behavior. Current projects are focused on marine sponges. We aim to improve our understanding of the diversity, evolutionary history, and ecological services of sponges in rocky reef habitats in California. These kelp forest habitats contain an astonishing diversity of suspension-feeding marine invertebrates. Together with other colonial filter feeders like tunicates, anthozoans, and bryozoans, sponges occupy a considerable portion of the hard-bottom substrate in shallow waters. Despite the important ecological roles and services of these taxa, we know little about the ecology or evolution of most species in this benthic community.

      My main research focus with the SBC LTER is on the role of history in ecological restoration in the coastal zone.  To this end I have been working with Jenny Dugan on the ecological history of the Coal Oil Point area on the west campus of UCSB.  My particular interest is in exploiting a variety of historical materials (e.g., maps, photos, print and manuscript documents) to find out about past and current human impacts and hopefully inform discussions of restoration and resilience.  I'm also interested in policies concerning endangered species.

SBC LTER's long term investigations of the processes affecting the dynamics of giant kelp forests distributed throughout the Santa Barbara Channel allow us to contrast results of population genetics with the continuous body of data and hypotheses driven by long time studies. With co-funding from FCT (Portuguese Science Foundation) we isolated microsatellite markers from giant kelp, which we are using to estimate the genetic connectivity among sites within the SBC LTER region.  We are also using these genetic markers to investigate several hypotheses concerning biogeography, population dynamics and reproductive biology.

My experimental work concentrates on examining potential feedbacks between urchin grazing fronts and the diversity of sessile species on reefs subjected to disturbance from storms.  I am also examining the consequences of wave disturbance to kelp forest food webs.  During the past fifty years, average winter storm frequency and intensity has increased.  These storms remove giant kelp, a foundation species that provides both habitat structure and food for rocky reefs.  I am using long-term data records to look at the direct and indirect effects of wave disturbance on food web structure via changes in kelp abundance and productivity.

      My work with the SBCLTER involves bringing an ongoing dataset of invertebrate settlement into the program. This dataset is geographically extensive (Mendocino to San Diego counties in California), and is unique in its length (currently at 22 years) and high frequency of collection (bi-weekly). Project goals include characterizing patterns of larval settlement in relation to oceanographic parameters and using population genetics to gain insights into possible larval connectivity and linking larval settlement to benthic population dynamics. Past work has identified geographical differences in shifting oceanographic regimes (e.g. El Nino/La Nina conditions and Pacific Decadal Oscillations) on settlement patterns between northern and southern California. Some applications include use of sea urchin settlement as a fishery independent measure of stock health, examination of differences in settlement of commercially harvested species inside and outside of no-take reserves (MPAs) and marine conservation areas, and the provision of long-term, geographically extensive library of invertebrate larvae to detect possible signals of ocean acidification. This work has been made possible by the development of an extensive collaboration with the fishing community, university researchers, marine resource managers, regulatory and public agencies, which now includes the SBCLTER.

      My research is focused on marine ecology, however I have wide range of related interests in other topics ranging from network theory to science education. Much of my current research focuses on the ecology of coastal benthic communities and interactions with the nearshore oceanography. As the SBC LTER Co-Director of Education I work with SBC scientists, staff, and students in various K-12 and public education programs. I lead the Biodiversity strand of the NSF-funded Math Science Partnership program: Pathways to Ecological Literacy focused on developing research-based environmental literacy learning progressions for 6-12 grades. Our site-based programs bring teachers and students to the UCSB campus to increase content knowledge about key science concepts that relate to the SBC LTER research program.

      As the Outreach Coordinator I work with SBC scientists, staff, and students in K-12 education and outreach programs both on and off campus.  With UCSB and other LTER science education representatives, I develop content and programs to articulate the research of the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER, particularly for K-12 needs (students and teachers) and for undergraduates. We  incorporate standards-aligned, hands-on programs as well as current research in science education. UCSB's remarkable beach-front location allows for the design, development and implementation of unique and strategic STEM content which is derived directly from SBC research. The campus serves as the hub for our LTER Schoolyard programs, mainly through our teaching aquarium, the Research Experience & Education Facility (REEF, WILL PUT REEF LINK HERE).  At the REEF, UCSB undergraduates act as mentors to local high school students, and so gain teaching experience as they pass on their knowledge and research experience. Related SBC LTER K-12 outreach projects I am involved in are "Pathways to Ecological Literacy" (funded through MSP), and a collaboration with the Santa Barbara Unified School District and the UCB Lawrence Hall of Science which brings ocean science to local 6th graders via teacher professional development.

      My research interest is investigating the effects of ocean acidification on the biogeochemical cycling of carbon in the ocean and the resulting implications for both marine ecosystems and atmospheric CO2 levels. My work in the Carlson laboratory focuses on the short-term and long-term impacts of increasing pCO2 on the use of dissolved organic carbon by natural bacterioplankton communities. With this research focus, my graduate work will help to better constrain surface carbon budgets and enable predictions of the degree to which the global oceans will continue to be a sink for anthropogenic-derived CO2.

      I research the fates and uses of grazed kelp and kelp detritus within kelp forests both in northeastern New Zealand and within the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER site. To do so, I run field and lab experiments and I measure natural abundances of fatty acids, and carbon and nitrogen isotopes for work with biomarkers. I've directly measured small particle kelp sloughing rates to measure availability of kelp detritus to subtidal suspension feeders. I'm currently working on measuring suspension feeder utilization of kelp detritus, both through natural sloughing availability and through urchin modulated bioavailability.

      Raine is interested in both community ecology and mathematical modeling. She is particularly interested in using models to better understand species interactions in marine communities and how these interactions may be affected by environmental stressors. Her work in the Moeller Lab leverages the Santa Barbara Coastal and Moorea Coral Reef LTER datasets. Raine began her research career by modeling the interactions between Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp), benthic macroalgae, and sessile invertebrates and how this system is affected by disturbance from storms. More recently, she is exploring the incorporation of coral-associated animals into models of coral growth and bleaching.

      I am interested in subsidies to beach ecosystems and their associated organisms. Sandy beaches along the southern California coast are receive organic matter and nutrient inputs through the deposition of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) wrack onto the beach. This material supports a variety of consumers through the provision of both habitat and food. I am interested in determining the extent of kelp inputs to beaches across a range of both types and during different seasonal conditions. I am also interested in how the variation in kelp inputs along the SBC LTER coastline controls community compositions and consumer behavior. I will explore these questions and more through kelp tagging and tracking experiments and beach surveys of consumer populations.

      I am interested in the status and trends in biodiversity and ecological function of sandy beach ecosystems, which make up ~75% of the California coastline. My research will evaluate hypotheses concerning alteration in intertidal biodiversity as a result of shifts in species distributions along with habitat change in response to climate change, other press and pulse environmental drivers, and a variety of anthropogenic activities over the last 30+ years using a combination of historic, mid-range and new datasets. My project will benefit from the core research on SBC beaches and historic and modern data on the abundance of giant kelp, a key resource for beach ecosystems, collected by the SBC LTER for my analyses. SBC-LTER will also be a source of expertise and digital infrastructure needed to archive the newly aquired historic datasets from California beaches.

      I oversee marine field operations for the SBC-LTER.  This includes training and mentoring students to safely and efficiently conduct our monitoring surveys while they are using  SCUBA and our boat, the R/V Kelpfish.  This also includes coordinating and conducting kelp forest monitoring surveys and experiments.  I also assist Dr. Reed and other senior investigators with experimental design and implementation.   My current research focuses on developing a non-destructive method to monitor invertebrate biomass in our local kelp forests.

      I am interested in the biogeochemical cycling of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the marine environment through heterotrophic bacterioplankton processes.  DOC serves as an organic substrate for heterotrophic microbial production, and as a result of this production organic matter is then re-mineralized.  DOC availability and microbial processes therefore have important implications for the distribution of nutrients in marine ecosystems.  A preliminary study conducted by SBC LTER in 2005 showed that while DOC concentrations were observed to be low in offshore waters of the SB channel (equal to or less than oligotrophic values), in the near shore there was at times a large accumulation of DOC resulting in a striking gradient extending from Mohawk Kelp Forest several km into the Channel.  In the Santa Barbara Coastal ecosystem, a unique case exists in that the continental shelf is extremely narrow (being only a few km wide in areas), allowing greater potential for exchange between near shore rocky reef ecosystems and offshore waters.  In response to these observations, my Masters' research project was designed to assess the temporal and spatial variability of organic nutrients and heterotrophic bacteriplankton dynamics across this near shore shelf system.  16 monthly oceanographic cruises were conducted from January 2008-April 2009 along a transect from Mohawk Kelp Forest 3km into the channel. Measurements of dissolved and particulate organic matter, inorganic nutrients, and bacterioplankton abundance, activity and community structure were carried out.  Results will give a better understanding of biogeochemical cycling of organic matter in this near shore ecosystem.

      Rocky reef ecosystems are largely dominated by giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, whose quick growth and monopolization of light is well documented as a mechanism for competitive exclusion among most benthos associated primary producers.  Relief from intense competition for light is accomplished through disturbance events associated with large winter swells that forcefully uproot Macrocystis individuals reduce surface canopy density and allow ample light to reach the seafloor.  To better understand patterns, causes, and ecological consequences of change in understory algal productivity, I am working to develop a logistically simple model incorporating irradiance, photosynthesis vs. irradiance and understory algal abundance data collected by the SBC LTER.
