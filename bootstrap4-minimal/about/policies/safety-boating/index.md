			<h2>Boating and Dive Safety</h2>
			
          <p>SBC LTER has a small boat, RV Kelpfish, a 22’ Radon that is available for use by certified SBC
			  graduate students and other researchers. We also use the fleet of small boats maintained by
			  UCSB’s Marine Operations program on a recharge basis.
		  </p>
		  <p>The Small Boat Committee consists of the Launchmaster, 1 researcher, and 1
graduate student. At present (Feb 2019-Feb 2022), the committee is:
<ul>
	<li>Clint Nelson (Launchmaster, Unit Dive Safety Officer)</li>
	<li>Robert Miller (PI)</li>
	<li>Joey Peters (Graduate student)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Small Boat Committee
	<ol>
		<li>Review small boat procedures at least once a year</li>
		<li>Grant permission for boat use to individuals</li>
		<li>Be notified of all new certifications for boat use and any changes made to the boating regulations</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>The Launchmaster is in control of day-to-day operations originating at the UCSB Marine Lab. The complete Small Boat Policy is available (LINK TBD)</p>
