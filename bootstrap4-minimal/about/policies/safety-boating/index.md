			<h2>Boating and Dive Safety</h2>
			
          <p>SBC LTER has a small boat, RV Kelpfish, a 22’ Radon that is available for use by certified SBC
			  graduate students and other researchers. We also use the fleet of small boats maintained by
			  UCSB’s Marine Operations program on a recharge basis.
		  </p>
		  <p>The Small Boat Committee consists of the Launchmaster, 1 researcher, and 1
graduate student. At present, the committee is:
<ul>
	<li>Clint Nelson (Launchmaster, Unit Dive Safety Officer)</li>
	<li>Robert Miller (PI)</li>
	<li>Joey Peters (Graduate student)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Small Boat Committee will:
	<ol>
		<li>Review small boat procedures at least once a year</li>
		<li>Grant permission for boat use to individuals</li>
		<li>Be notified of all new certifications for boat use and any changes made to the boating regulations</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>The Launchmaster oversees the daily operations at the UCSB Marine Lab. The <a href="https://sbclter.msi.ucsb.edu/external/Documents/Policies/Boating_Policy.pdf">Small Boat Policy</a> is publicly accessible, and further information is available upon request.</p>

	<h2>Laboratory Safety</h2>
	<blockquote>
    <p>Lab safety  follows UCSB  and UC system protocols. Lab supervisors are responsible for ensuring that their workers have received documented safety training. At SBC, training for undergraduate volunteers is formal, occurring at the start of the academic year.  The lead field tech conducts an annual lab safety review, and coordinates training with <a href="http://www.ehs.ucsb.edu/training">UCSB Environmental Health and Safety</a>.
