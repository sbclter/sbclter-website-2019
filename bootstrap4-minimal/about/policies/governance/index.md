			   <p>SBC is directed by an Executive Committee chaired by lead PI Miller, and includes Co-PIs for the entire 6 year funding period. Associate Investigators are added as rotating positions, and are generally filled by individuals with lead roles in the current short-term  studies. The project coordinator, information manager and a graduate student round out the committee. </p>

			<p> Regular scheduled meetings are held to inform and solicit input from all investigators, post docs, graduate students, and staff. The meetings serve to keep participants informed of the projectâ€™s broad range of activities, which aids in coordination and integration of the different project components. This management style has been very effective in instilling a culture of shared ownership, enthusiasm and pride for the project among participants. </p>
