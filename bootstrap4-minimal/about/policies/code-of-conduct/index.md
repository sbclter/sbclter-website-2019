		   <h2>SBC LTER Code of Conduct</h2>
		   <p class="lead">The Santa Barbara Coastal (SBC) LTER site neither condones nor tolerates harassment or intimidation of any kind including, but not limited to, hazing of new participants, physical or verbal intimidation, and sexual harassment. Our history of excellent science is built upon supportive collaboration and teamwork. We encourage anyone who feels that they have been harassed or bullied in any way, or that may have witnessed incidents involving harassment or bullying, to contact their team leader, project PI, and/or the SBC LTER Lead PI or Co-PIs. Communication is essential. It is our expectation that all SBC participants demonstrate respect for each other and everyone else they work with on and off the UCSB campus.
