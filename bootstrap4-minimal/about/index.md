    <p>Each LTER site involves dozens of researchers. At SBC this includes includes microbial, 
    population, and  community ecologists, oceanographers, physiologists, biogeochemists, social scientists,
     economists and educators. The shared knowledge of place offers unusual common ground for
     exploring disciplinary intersections.</p>

<p>The Santa Barbara Channel is a transition zone between the cold waters of the California Current 
and the warmer waters of Southern California, and is considered a transition zone between the Oregonian and 
Californian marine faunal provinces. Transition zones may be particularly susceptible to shifts in the composition 
of marine species driven by environmental variability. Pt. Conception (34.448 N, 120.471 W), at the western boundary
of the Channel, is a major biogeographic and coastal oceanic boundary that strongly influences the 
physical and biological dynamics of the marine ecosystems within the Channel.  </p>

<p>The mix of biogeographic provinces, warm and cool oceanic regimes and nearshore and offshore waters 
in the Santa Barbara Channel region results in a remarkably high biodiversity of marine organisms 
including marine mammals, seabirds, fish, invertebrates, plankton and algae. For example, at least 
27 species of cetaceans have been recorded in the Santa Barbara Channel and 18 are considered resident, 
representing both northern and southern forms. Gray whales travel south through the channel in 
December and January, returning with calves on their northward trip from February to April as 
they migrate between feeding areas in the Bering Sea and breeding lagoons in Baja California, Mexico.

<!-- NOTE, TO DO
<p>See git, issue #31.
maybe a paragraph here with some other details? Dan had wanted a way to find out which 
researchers worked in which areas. Ideally, this could be done with another bit of coding
(with other people stuff).  so there are 
two choices: (a) keep it up to date manually now and code it later 
(b) wait till later. </p>

                    <h2>About the LTER Network</h2>
            <p>The events
that influence ecosystems can be infrequent and often unpredictable. Major droughts,
hurricanes, the arrival of a new species, or a shift in ocean currents can dramatically affect the
way an ecosystem looks and functions. Legacies from past events can cause two sites that look
superficially similar to behave in very different ways. Yet most ecological studies are funded just
a few years at a time. In 1980, the National Science Foundation founded the Long-Term Ecological Research
(LTER)
network to provide a longer view. Today, research programs at LTER sites support ecological
discovery on the influence of long-term and large-scale phenomena across a wide range of
ecosystems including arctic tundra, grasslands, forests, estuaries, and coral reefs, and the
kelp forests here off Santa Barbara. </p> 

        <p>LTER sites also serve the wider scientific community by:
        <ul>
        <li>making almost 40 years of sustained observations publicly available</li>
        <li>developing and maintaining long-term experiments, which help to explain the
mechanisms that cause ecosystem change</li>
        <li>providing long-term context and deep knowledge of place for researchers working on
shorter-term projects training hundreds of graduate students in interdisciplinary and
collaborative team science</li>
</ul>
