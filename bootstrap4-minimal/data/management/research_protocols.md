 			<h3><a name="PM"></a>Definitions of 'Protocol' and 'Method'</h3>
 			<p>Technically, the two terms are different: Protocols are 'prescriptive' and methods
 			are 'descriptive'. That is, a protocol is a set of instructions for how to do a task
 			- like a recipe -
 			and a method describes how you actually did the task. Generally, the protocol
 			gets written before (e.g., so it can be taken into the field), and
 			the methods after (methods are written up for a paper). So your methods could be
 			as simple as "we followed the x protocol." A protocol might say "filter 250 ml
 			water", but your methods might say "if the filter clogged, we filtered only 100 ml."
 			</p>
 			<p>In reality, what we call a 'protocol document' often includes both protocol
 			and methods, especially when a single document is updated with protocol changes.
 			For now this is unavoidable.

       <div class="col-md-8">
			 <p>We  publish protocols (or methods) with our datasets.
			  It helps to assure that even our old data will be intelligible and interpretable
			  far in the future. So all our protocol docs are archived as PDFs so they can
			  be accessed with commonly used free software. It may seem like a chore, but the LTER is
			  considered by NSF and many others to be an example of good data management
			  practices, so we want to keep our reputation shiny. The policies and
			  practices for SBC LTER datasets are outlined below. </p>

			 
			    <!-- you want this table to start below the menu box, or it will be pushed over
			    to the right -->
			    <p>
			    There are 2 kinds of protocols: those which are SBC-originated (endogenous)
			    and those which
			    are lab-originated (or exogenous). The two types differ in the style of
			    maintenance,    and in how they are named and attached to datasets.
			    We do not require collaborating researchers to create a protocol document
			    specifically for SBC.
			</p>
            
			
			<ul>
			<li>
			<u>The SBC-originated protocols (endogenous) were written for the SBC LTER
			project</u>, although
			they may be modifications of those used by researchers for their other projects.
			 SBC-originated protocols are   maintained over time in a single document and
			 changes recorded there.    Examples include most
			    of the reef group's protocols for community surveys.
			    </li>
			    <li class="mt-1">
			    <u>Lab-originated protocols are exogenous to SBC, i.e., they were developed by
			     individual reaserchers in their own labs</u>, and adopted by SBC mainly through 
			     collaboration. So these protocols  are usually already standard practice in
			     a researcher's laboratory. Most of the non-reef    protocols fall into this
			     category, e.g., the    DOC filtration protocols from the
			     Carlson lab, mooring data collection   and processing from
			    the Washburn lab, or stream gauge and chemistry sampling from the Melack laboratory.

			    </li>
			    </ul>
			
		           <p>
		       Endogenous protocols are generally easier to maintain and keep track of, mainly
		       because these are handled by staffers dedicated to SBC. Our use of exogenous protocols
		       is harder to track, because SBC does not control when, why or how contributing
		       laboratories manage their work; we rely on their expertise. All protocols are associated with
		       datasets, so tracking protocols is more
		       complicated when exogenous protocols are used in SBC long-term time-series.
		       We have developed some recommendations
		       for those tasked with handling datasets and their associated protocols (or methods).
		       As of this writing (mid 2011), our use of protocols has not always followed
		    all    'recommended practices'.</p>
			    <ol>
			    <li class="mt-1">File Location:<br />
			Put the final versions of protocol docs in your group's /Final/Protocols/.
			The IM will retrieve the PDF version from there. If you don't have
			the software to create a PDF, a word-doc or text file is fine, and the IM can build
			the PDF. /Final/ is the
			directory where other SBC LTER people will go to find the material you intend to be
			shared (the /Working/ folder is for work-in-progress).
			<br />
			It is recommended to archive the older versions in Final, e.g., under
			 Ocean/Final/Protocols/ARCHIVE. <!-- If you'd rather not keep an archive under /Final/,
			 that's fine, because past versions that we've linked to in
			datasets are already archived permanently. -->
			 </li>

			    <li  class="mt-1">File naming and versions:<br />
			 Exogenous protocol document  will include:
			 	<ol>
					<li> the name of the lab where it originated and</li>
					<li> a publication date.</li>
		 	   </ol>

			 This way, we can preserve our old protocols for linking to datasets.
			   So your file "CHN_filtration.pdf" will become "Brzezinski_20090601_CHN_filtration.pdf".
			   when it's archived. This also gives us information on the history of the protocol, e.g.,
			   if the CHN analysis were to move to a different lab.
			 Many of the protocols already linked to datasets do not have dates or names as part 
			 of their file names, but new ones will. A good example is the cruise datasets,
			 which used 3 or 4 different primary production protocols, and are dated.

			 <br />
			Note: We have not yet established naming or dating conventions for SBC-originated protocols.
			 However, it would make sense to prefix these files names with "SBC_LTER_", or
			 the investigator's name and a date, since it is likely that
			 these will eventually be shared beyond our group.
			</li>
			


			<li  class="mt-1">Recording changes in time series data:<br />
			Since protocols change over time, we should be stating in the dataset when we
			switch. So when a protocol changes, please let the IM know. The IM should
			also set up scripts to audit additions or changes to the Final/Protocol directory.
			<br />At some point in the future, we should add this additonal material to
			time series. This is probably tedious, but hopefully this is recorded in the
			sample logs.
			When the dates are known, the IM can add text to the dataset, as in
			"this protocol was followed 2002-2006".
			<br />
