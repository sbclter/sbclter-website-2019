<h1> Data Help Desk </h1>

<p> If you have questions related to data access, data publication, and data cleanning, here are some documents that can assist you.  </p>

<hr/>
<h4>Get SBC login</h4>

<p>Usually an investigator or staff member requests a login for new students, staff or associate investigators. 
  Those requesting a login should contact <a href="/about/people/lkui/">Li Kui</a> (SBC's information manager), 
  and provide the new partipant's name, email address and advisor's name. If you have an active login, 
  your name will show up on <a href="/about/people/"> SBC's People page</a>. </p>

<hr/>
<h4>Data access through data catalog</h4>

<p><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/external/Documents/data_help/SBCLTER_DataDownloadProtocol_WithWebsite.pdf">SBC data review and download protocol</a> demonstrates dataset search, metadata review, dataset download, and dataset citation.
    </p>

 <hr/>
<h4>Dataset publication</h4>

<p>To publish your dataset, please download the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/external/Documents/data_help/Metadata_collection.zip">SBC data publication template</a> in a zipped file that includes the metadata collection 
    Excel worksheet as well as abstract and method word documents.  </p>
    
  
<p> <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/external/Documents/data_help/Instruction_on_filling_out_metadata.pdf">SBC data publication instruction</a> will show you how to fill out the meatadata sheet and prepare your data for publication. If you are a first time user, this is the step-by-step <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n7TteZFbpc">metadata tutorial Youtube video</a> to guide you through the process. 
     </p>

 <hr/>
 <h4>Access SBC server via Web Browser</h4>
<p>Access to SBC server requires a SBC login name and password, which is the same as MSI login name and password. <a href="https://sbc.lternet.edu/internal">Login to Internal File Server</a></p> 
<p>Remember, you can always download files from your browser, at "Internal Data", but you may not deposit files this way. Additionally, downloads via a browser will be one file at a time.</p> 
<p>If you encounter any issue about file permission, please review <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/external/Documents/data_help/potential_data_sharing_issue.pdf">SBC data sharing permission issue</a>.</p> 


<h4>Access SBC server via network drive mapping</h4>
<p>SBC user can <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/external/Documents/data_help/SBC_map_network_drive.pdf">map SBC file sever</a> on your computer, 
which allows you to view all SBC related documents, pictures, data, collaborated projects as 
if it were a drive on your UCSB desktop. Only the computers on campus or connected via VPN 
(<a href="https://www.it.ucsb.edu/get-connected-vpn">UCSB VPN</a>) can map the SBC server. 
    </p> 

 <hr/>
 <h4>Data management plan</h4>
<p>In 2011, NSF added a requirement that all proposals include a 2-page Data Management Plan. In LTER, data management plans have been a requirement for a much longer time, and generally, 
the LTER Network is a leader in data management practices for diverse environmental data. SBC has gathered some resources for scientists writing data management plans for NSF proposals. 
These resources include a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/internal/information_management/NSF_data_mgt_plans/00_NSF_data_management_plan_template_DRAFT.rtf">
 template data management plan (require login) </a> for collaborative projects which plan to post their data in the SBC LTER data catalog.
  
<p>If you plan to house your data in the SBC system, it is essential that the <a href="mailto:lkui@ucsb.edu">SBC information manager</a> and SBC leadership be kept informed of your proposal's progress. </p>
