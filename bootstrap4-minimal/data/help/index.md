<h1> Data Help Desk </h1>

<p> If you have questions related to data access, data publication, and data management plans, here are some documents that can assist you.  </p>

<hr/>
<h4>Data access through data catalog</h4>

<p><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/external/Documents/data_help/SBCLTER_DataDownloadProtocol_WithWebsite.pdf">SBC data review and download protocol</a> demonstrates dataset search, metadata review, dataset download, and dataset citation.
    </p>

 <hr/>
<h4>Dataset publication</h4>

<p>To publish your dataset, please download the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/external/Documents/data_help/Metadata_collection.zip">SBC data publication template</a> in a zipped file that includes the metadata collection 
    Excel worksheet as well as abstract and method word documents.  </p>
    
  
<p> <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/external/Documents/data_help/Instruction_on_filling_out_metadata.pdf">SBC data publication instruction</a> will show you how to fill out the meatadata sheet and prepare your data for publication. If you are a first time user, this is the step-by-step <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n7TteZFbpc">metadata tutorial Youtube video</a> to guide you through the process. 
     </p>

 <h4>Data Workshops</h4>
 <p>The Information Management Office offers workshops on data management throughout the year, covering essential skills in <a href="{{page.url}}workshop_data_access/">Data Discovery</a>, <a href="{{page.url}}workshop_data_inspection/">Data Inspection</a>, and <a href="{{page.url}}workshop_data_publication/">Data Publication</a>, with a focus on SBC LTER data. These sessions also introduce additional repositories and advanced techniques to enhance research capabilities in ecological data management.</p>
 <hr/>
<h4>Access SBC server via network drive mapping</h4>
<p>SBC user can <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/external/Documents/data_help/SBC_map_network_drive.pdf">map SBC file sever</a> on your computer, which allows you to view all SBC related documents, pictures, data, collaborated projects as 
if it were a drive on your UCSB desktop. Only the computers on campus or connected via VPN 
(<a href="https://www.it.ucsb.edu/get-connected-vpn">UCSB VPN</a>) can map the SBC server. 
    </p> 
 <p> Internal data access requires an SBC server account in the GRIT system. Usually an investigator or staff member requests the account for new students, staff or associate investigators. Those requesting the login account should contact <a href="/about/people/lkui/">Li Kui</a> (SBC's information manager), and provide the new partipant's name, email address and advisor's name.</p>
<p>If you have an active account in the GRIT system, the password setup/reset portal can be found on the <a href="https://selfservice.grit.ucsb.edu/">self-service page</a>. </p> 

 <hr/>
 <h4>Data management plan</h4>
<p>In 2011, NSF added a requirement that all proposals include a 2-page Data Management Plan. In LTER, data management plans have been a requirement for a much longer time, and generally, the LTER Network is a leader in data management practices for diverse environmental data. If you plan to collaborate with SBC and house your data in the SBC system, it is essential that the <a href="mailto:lkui@ucsb.edu">SBC information manager</a> and SBC leadership be kept informed of your proposal's progress. </p>
