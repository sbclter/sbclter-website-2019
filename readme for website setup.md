Using css classes for row, columns

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/ (edited) 

The row size is 12 units. And row put inner divs horizontally.
So you can do something like this, and the 3 divs will be on the same row (unless you set min-width to some pixel value.)
``` 
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6"></div>
    <div class="col-md-1"></div>
    <div class="col-md-5"></div>
</div> 
```
